Adds support for the Science Pack Galore packs to any labs that Disco Science works with.
Note that this mod does not add any functionality on its own; it simply allows the labs to cycle through the Science Pack Galore pack colors in use, in addition to any other packs.

I tried to choose the colors based on roughly the same reference point on the science packs for consistency. Some may be more subtle than others just based on the color involved.
